# Movie List
This project is a simple app to keep track of a list of movies the user has not seen, but wants to.
It was made using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to automate the build process, and [this tutorial](https://github.com/wesdoyle/react-firebase-notes-app) as a template.
***
## Future updates
* Add a log in feature so the app can be used by more than one person
* Add an alphabetize feature to put the movies in order
* Add a feature to get info about the movie from RT or some other site
